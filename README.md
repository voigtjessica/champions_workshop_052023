# champions_workshop_052023
Repository for TM creating for the Champions 1rst Workshop 2023

Main Files:

- joining_old_and_new_concept.ipynb = don't consider this script. Since the concept annotation was divided in two parts, I join the first and seccond part of the work in this script. 
- df_final_clean.csv : is the result of the script above, that we will use to perform the TM (I'll use only the df_original['concept'] )

- parameter_choosing_austrian_speeches.ipynb : I perform all the TM in this file. I don't have the parameter choosing designated folder, since the procedure let me to just one parameter. This is the same procedure I adopted in the Champions_2.0 repository.
